# Deep-Learning
initial notes and projects created during my journey to understand 'Deep Learning' (since Aug 22')


### Brief outline of how I would go about learning deep-learning from someone without a computer science degree.
0. Review of Python (Basic object oriented programming, Pandas, Numpy)
1. Read each chapter of fastbook<https://course.fast.ai/> in Jupyter Notebook<https://github.com/fastai/fastbook>
2. Watch the lectures and follow through lecture notes<https://github.com/fastai/course22>
3. Try work on personal projects (that is a slight variation from class exercises)

### Initial comments on ideas I found fascinating about Deep Learning:
- Deep learning is intuitive and that is what it makes it quite difficult to learn. Intuition is learned from experiences and repetitive practices.
I wonder, if that is why it feels more arduous to learn something as basic as classifying images or finding patterns to summarize a short paragraph
challenging tasks to do.
